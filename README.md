Most code will take the form of a Jupyter Python Notebook. Usual scientific libraries will be used (i.e. numpy, scipy, matplotlib). For those of you new to Python and/or Jupyter notebooks, I recommend using an environemt manager like Anaconda or miniconda. I may occasionally post some MATLAB code (although I promise to try to avoid it).
